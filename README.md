# belsen-fortigate-leak

No leak data is contained here.  Just a file tree, and ip list

Files:
ip_by_country.txt 
  This is the filetree that contains the full list of IP Addresses, sorted by Country.  It also contains the names of all of the files from the ip as well.

ipaddresses.txt
  This file, carves up the ip addresses, sorts them numerically, then reassembles it to this file.  It is much easier searching by IP instead of by file tree for some.
